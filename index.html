 (うちは イタチ, Uchiha Itachi)
 is a character in the Naruto 
manga and anime series created
 by Masashi Kishimoto. Itachi is
  the older brother of Sasuke Uchiha,
   and is responsible for killing
 all the members of their clan, sparing
  only Sasuke. He appears working as
   a terrorist from the organisation 
   Akatsuki and serves as
  Sasuke's greatest enemy. During
   the second part of the manga, Itachi
    becomes involved in attacks to ninjas
     possessing tailed-beast
   creatures until facing Sasuke in a one-on-one
    battle. Although Itachi perishes during the
     final duel, it is later revealed that Itachi
    had a secret reason for assassinating the 
    Uchiha clan. Itachi is a playable character
     in most of the video games from the series. </p>
